h1. django-compress features

This is a application that will provide an easy and automated way to output compressed/minified CSS and JavaScript. It adheres to the DRY principle, you set up your CSS-files and JavaScript-files in your project settings, and you are done. There is no need to enter the names in your template again (a couple of template tags takes care of that).

* Group/concatenate your CSS/JavaScript source files to single files, and run the code through specified filters
* Provides sane defaults for CSS (CSSTidy required) and JavaScript minification.
* A filter for YUI Compressor is included.
* It’s easy and straightforward to write custom compressors/filters to generate the output. Filters for jsmin and CSSTidy is included by default.
* A last-modifcation/version part can automatically be appended to the filename of the outputted files to make use of “far future Expires HTTP header), and provide an automated way of updating the content without delays.
* You setup and group your CSS and JavaScript-files in the settings, and set up whetter or not you want your files to be compressed.
* Templatetags to output CSS (<link...>) or JavaScript (<script...>) tags with the compressed files if COMPRESS = True, or otherwise the source files.
* The compressed files will be updated (if neeeded) when you are accessing them from the templatetags. This only applies when COMPRESS_AUTO is enabled. You can manually update them with “./manage.py synccompress”.
