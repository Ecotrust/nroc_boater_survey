Screencasts SETUP

This app requires videos, images, and a video player. Screencast fields 
(including videos, images, title, description, etc) can be  
adjusted via the admin.  The video player can be downloaded from 
http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/  The video player 
should be saved in media/screencasts/video-player (see settings.VIDEO_PLAYER)

The following storage guidelines are for the north coast nc_mlpa project:

- The videos should be saved in media/projects/nc_mlpa/screencasts 
(see settings.SCREENCASTS)
- The images should be saved in media/projects/nc_mlpa/screencasts/images 
(see settings.SCREENCAST_IMAGES)

The .flv videos are currently in maps14 (in media/screencasts) and will have to 
be updated from mm v1 to mm v2.

Also, the Screencast model uses ImageField which may require the installation of 
PIL (Python Image Library)
